<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RAS Error Record Register Interface (RERI) specification augments
Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) features in the SoC with a
standard mechanism for reporting errors by means of a memory-mapped register
interface to enable error reporting, provide the facility to log the detected
errors (including their severity, nature, and location), and configuring means
to signal the error to a RAS handler component. The RAS handler may use this
information to determine suitable recovery actions that may include terminating
the computation (e.g., terminating a process), restarting parts or all of
the system, etc. to recover from the errors. Additionally, this specification
shall support software-initiated error logging, reporting, and testing of RAS
handlers. Lastly, this specification shall provide maximal flexibility to
implement error handling and coexists with RAS frameworks defined by other
standards such as PCIe cite:[PCI] and CXL cite:[CXL].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A system is an entity that interacts with other entities such as other systems,
software, operators, etc. to deliver one or more services in its role as a
service provider. A system may itself be a consumer of one or more services
provided by one or more other systems. A system thus is a collection of
interacting components that implement one or more functions to provide a
service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A service is the behavior as perceived by the consumers of the service. A system
may implement the service as one or more functions in the system. The functions
used to compose the service may be implemented by one or more components in the
system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A service is described as a set of states that can be observed by the consumer
of the service. The set of states observed by the consumer of the service may be
further dependent on a set of internal states of the functions that implement
the service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A service is said to be correct if the set of states observed by the consumer of
the service match the specification of that service. The specifications of a
service may include its functional behavior, performance goals,
security objectives, and RAS requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reliability of a system as a function of time is the probability it continues to
provide correct service and may be characterized by metrics such as mean time
between failures (MTBF). The services provided by a reliable system fail on
faults instead of silently producing incorrect results. Reliable systems
incorporate methods to detect occurrence of errors and to signal the errors to
the consumers of the service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Availability of a system as a function of time is the probability that the
system provides the expected service and is a measure of tolerance to errors.
Systems may increase their availability by minimizing the impact of the errors in
one part of the system to the rest of the system. This may be achieved by means
such as error correction, redundancy, state checkpoints and rollbacks, error
prediction, and error containment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Serviceability is a measure of time to restore the service to correct operation
with minimal disruption to the consumers of the service. These may be achieved
by means such as identifying and reporting failures and supporting mechanisms to
repair and bring the system back online.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="faults-and-errors"><a class="anchor" href="#faults-and-errors"></a>Faults and Errors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fault is an incorrect state resulting from failures of components or due to
interference from the environment in which the system operates. A fault is
permanent if it reflects an irreversible change to the observable system state
and is transient otherwise. A permanent fault may occur due to a physical
defect or due to a flaw in the design of the functions implementing the service
itself. A transient fault may occur due to temporary environmental conditions
(cosmic rays, voltage glitches, etc.) or due to instability (e.g. marginal
hardware).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some faults that occur in a component may be dormant and only affect the
internal state of the component. Such dormant faults however may turn into
active faults when that internal state is used by the computation process in
that component and produce an error. An error is detected when its presence is
indicated by an error message or signal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software faults may similarly cause errors that cause the service provided by
the system to deviate from its specification. Well known software engineering
and reliability techniques may be employed to prevent, detect and recover from
software errors. Software errors are not in the scope of this specification.
Software should not have the ability to induce hardware errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A service failure occurs when the service deviates from its specification due
to errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A reliable system deals with errors through one or more of the following
techniques cite:[RAS_TAX] cite:[EXA_RAS]:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fault prevention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error detection and correction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error prediction</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="fault-prevention"><a class="anchor" href="#fault-prevention"></a>Fault Prevention</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fault prevention involves use of techniques that reduce or prevent errors that
may occur after the product has been shipped. These may be accomplished through
the use of high quality in product design, technology selection, materials
selection, and manufacturing time screening for defects. Through the use of
systematic design, technology selection, and manufacturing tests many errors
such as those induced by electric fields, temperature stress, switching/coupling
noise (e.g. DRAM RowHammer cite:[RHAM] effect), incorrect V/F operating points,
insufficient guard bands, meta-stability, etc. can be prevented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faults that are not prevented may manifest as errors during operation of the
system. Errors that are not detected may still lead to a service failure. For
example, an undetected error in an adder used to produce the address of a load
may produce a bad address which causes the load to incur an exception and lead
to a service failure. Some undetected errors however may not manifest as
exceptions and cause a service failure due to silent data corruption. For
example, a circuit performing encryption of a database may silently cause an
error in the ciphertext produced leading to the entire database being left in a
state where it cannot be decrypted. Such undetected errors that do not lead to a
service failure are called Silent Data Errors (SDE). The impact of SDE is
generally much higher than errors that lead to a service failure. A resilient
system attempts to minimize the probability of SDE to the largest extent
possible by implementing error detection capabilities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="error-detection-and-correction"><a class="anchor" href="#error-detection-and-correction"></a>Error Detection and Correction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Error detection involves the use of coding and protocols to detect errors
cite:[EU_HPC] cite:[EXA_2014]. For example, caches with error correcting codes,
TLB entries with parity protection, buses with parity protection on transaction
fields, circuitry to detect unexpected and/or illegal encodings, gray codes,
voltage sensors, clock/PLL monitors, timing margin sensors, etc. Some components
such as memory controllers may actively attempt to detect errors using techniques
such as periodic background scrubbing or on-demand scrubbing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Error correction involves the use of techniques to correct the detected errors.
Error correction may be performed by employing error correcting codes and
protocols.  For example, a processor cache may employ error correcting codes
(ECC) to detect and correct errors. Some components may recover from errors by
using protocols that involve a retry. For example, a TLB that detects an error
may invalidate the entry and attempt to refill it from the page tables, a
receiver on a bus that detects an error may request the transmitter to
retransmit the transaction, etc. Error correction is thus complete when the
error is either corrected or it does not recur on retry. Such errors that were
corrected by the hardware are called <strong>Corrected Errors (CE)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Errors that could not be corrected are called uncorrected errors. A component
that detects an uncorrected error may allow possibly corrupted data to
propagate to the requester of the data but associate an indicator (e.g., poison)
with the data. Such errors are said to be <strong>Uncorrected Errors Deferred (UED)</strong> as
they allow the component to continue operation and defer dealing with the error
to a later point in time if the data corrupted by the error is consumed. Deferring
errors allows deferring the error handling to an ultimate consumer of the
corrupted data that may be able to provide more precise information to a RAS
handler about the contexts affected by the corruption and thus enable more
precise error recovery actions by the RAS handler. The component that detected
and deferred the error may notify a RAS handler by reporting the UED
but such a UED does not need an immediate remedial action to be performed by the
RAS handler.  For example, a memory controller may detect an uncorrectable ECC
error on data in memory but since there is no immediate consumer of the data the
memory controller may just mark the data as poisoned and defer the error
handling to a component that requests the data. If the poisoned data is never
consumed then deferred errors are benign. If the poisoned data is completely
overwritten with new data then the associated poison is cleared. If the poisoned
data is only partially written then the data continues to be marked as poisoned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A component that detects an uncorrected error may be unable to defer the
handling of the error by techniques such as poisoning. Such errors are said to
be <strong>Uncorrected Errors Critical (UEC)</strong> and a RAS handler is invoked as
immediate remedial actions are required. For example, a cache controller
may detect an uncorrectable ECC error on the memory used to hold cache tags
and since such errors cannot be attributed to any particular data element
these errors may be classified as UEC. If poisoned data is attempted to be
consumed by a component (e.g. a hart, an IOMMU, a device, etc.) then an UEC
occurs as immediate remedial actions are required and further deferral of the
error is not possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A component that signals a request for execution of an RAS handler
for an UEC may indicate that the error has not propagated beyond the boundaries
of the component that detected the error and thus may be <strong>containable</strong> through
recovery actions (e.g., terminating the computation, etc.) carried out by the
RAS handler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some components act as an intermediary through which the data passes through.
For example, a PCIe/CXL port is an intermediary component that by itself does
not consume the data it receives from memory but forwards the data to the
endpoint. In such cases the component may receive the data with a deferred
error. Such a component may propagate the error and not log an error by itself.
However, if the component to which the data is being propagated (e.g. a PCIe
endpoint) is not capable of handling poison then the former component  must
signal a UEC instead of propagating the corrupted data, as the act of
propagation breaks containment of the error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An error detected by a component may lead to a failure mode where the component
may not be able to service requests anymore (e.g. colloquially called jammed,
wedged, etc.). For example, an error in the hart pipeline may cause the hart to
stop committing instructions, a fabric may be in a state where it cannot process
any further requests, the link connecting the memory module to the host may have
failed, etc. In such cases invoking a RAS handler may not be useful
as the RAS handler itself may need to generate requests to the failed component
to perform the recovery actions. Components in such failed states may use an
implementation-defined signal to a system recovery controller (e.g., a Baseboard
Management Controller (BMC), an on-chip service controller, etc.) to initiate a
RAS-handling reset to restart the component, sub-system, or the system itself to
restore correct service operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="error-prediction"><a class="anchor" href="#error-prediction"></a>Error Prediction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Error prediction involves the use of corrected errors as a predictor of future
uncorrectable permanent failures or other systemic issues, such as marginality
due to aging. Monitoring corrected errors may facilitate the avoidance of future
service failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Studies indicate that the probability of an uncorrected DRAM error is elevated
if the DIMM previously experienced corrected errors cite:[DRAM_WILD]
cite:[SRI_2012] cite:[ZIV_2019]. Such reasoning is used by system protection
mechanisms, which utilize simple heuristics for offlining potentially failing
memory pages cite:[HWA_2012] cite:[MEZ_2015] cite:[TANG_2006] cite:[DU_2021] or
for replacing compromised DIMMs cite:[MAR_2014] cite:[DRAM_WILD] cite:[DU_2020].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reporting of detected and corrected hardware errors is requisite for any
quantitative analysis of system resilience and for the prediction of future
uncorrected errors cite:[EU_HPC]. This prediction capability facilitates the
deployment of preventive mechanisms, such as pre-failure alerts in
High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster management software, thus mitigating
the costs associated with unscheduled outages and system repairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Components of a resilient system may also include corrected error counters to
count the corrections performed. Such components may additionally include a
fixed or programmable threshold to notify a RAS handler when the number of
corrected errors surpasses the threshold.</p>

<h3 id="reri-features"><a class="anchor" href="#reri-features"></a>RERI Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version 1.0 of the RISC-V RERI specification supports the following features:</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Error severity classes and standard error codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard register format and addressing for memory-mapped error-record

</li>
<li>
<p>Rules for prioritized overwriting of valid error records with new error
